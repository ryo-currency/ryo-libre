## What's your history with Sumokoin?
You can read [one-page](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9eqa1x/blowing_the_lid_off_sumokoin_scam) list of sumokoin scam, that lead to partition. In short: we parted ways after one of the Sumo devs failed to disclose with the public a 400 000 coins premine unlocking years earlier [1](https://np.reddit.com/r/ryocurrency/comments/8ms1fx/on_an_epic_fail_hidden_premines_doctored/). Then two other team members resigned for a week [2](http://archive.is/obWug), one of which came back declaring "the "_i am getting out" was a mislead to earn time_" [3](http://archive.is/NdOKU). 

## I have Sumokoin, how can I claim my Ryo?
- You can claim your Ryo, **if you had Sumokoin before they forked at block #137500**. Ryo Currency as a chain fork kept all the transactions -and thus coins you had in your wallet- up and until Sumokoin forked at block #137500. To further secure your Ryo, we're going to tie the coins to a block after the fork.
- First, install the latest Ryo [wallet](https://ryo-currency.com/wallet/). Run it and generate a new wallet. Write down the seed words. Copy the PRIMARY ADDRESS under the RECEIVE tab. Then from the Ryo wallet Atom, click MENU - SWITCH WALLET Â» RESTORE WALLET FROM SEED and restore your Ryo from the same seeds used for your old Sumokoin wallet.
- Send all your coins to the new Ryo PRIMARY ADDRESS you copied before.
After this, you can safely transact Sumokoin, it's important to first move your Ryo, before you move your Sumokoin.
- If you are comfortable using the CLI, you can just SWEEP ALL Ryo to yourself instead of all the above.
